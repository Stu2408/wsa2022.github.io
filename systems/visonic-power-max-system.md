In the event the panel fails within this time we will replace it free of charge. This warranty extends to all parts of the system but does not cover battery replacement out with the first year.<br><br>

  The system is simple to operate and is turned on and off either by entering a code to the control panel or by using the remote control fobs.<br><br>
  The system has an on board voice module which literally speaks you through the steps to take to set or unset the system.<br><br>
  As with all systems we install the Powermax allows for partition setting meaning that if you wish to just set part of the system for example downstairs at night, then the system can be configured to allow you to do this.

  Although for the majority of customers an audible alarm system is sufficient the Powermax can send a voice message to a mobile or landline telephone to advise of activations or other system generated conditions. The system also has the capability to provide the additional security of alarm activation notification to either an Alarm Receiving Centre or direct via sms text message to a user’s mobile telephone. These options can be discussed with your security surveyor if required.

  Each sensor is fitted with a long life battery. Although it is not possible to indicate exactly how long a sensor battery will last due to the fact that this depends on how frequently the sensor is activated normal battery life is between 18 and 24 months. The control unit monitors battery life and alerts the user when a battery is running low. Diagnostic checks during routine maintenance also monitor battery capacity. In general battery life is slightly better than with other similar systems.

  Maintenance cover is available with various options from annual service and sensor battery replacement for <strong>£30.00</strong> to annual maintenance, battery replacement and full parts and labour warranty for <strong>£65.00</strong> per year.<br><br>
