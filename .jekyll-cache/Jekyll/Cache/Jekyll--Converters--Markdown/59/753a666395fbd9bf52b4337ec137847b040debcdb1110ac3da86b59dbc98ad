					Although for the majority of customers an audible alarm system is sufficient the Enforcer system has the capability to provide the additional security of alarm activation notification to either an Alarm Receiving Centre or direct via sms text message to a user’s mobile telephone. These options can be discussed with your security surveyor if required.

					Each sensor is fitted with a long life battery. Although it is not possible to indicate exactly how long a sensor battery will last due to the fact that this depends on how frequently the sensor is activated normal battery life is between 18 and 24 months. The control unit monitors battery life and alerts the user when a battery is running low. Diagnostic checks during routine maintenance also monitor battery capacity.
